# NERF THIS!
## My first Reddit bot.

This watches the subreddit r/overwatchmemes and looks for someone who complains about d.va and her needing a nerf by saying "nerf d.va" and replies back with a snarky "NERF THIS!!'.

## Linux + Python is Love

I'm using Linux Mint Mate v18.2 to run this script, as well as Python v2.7

## Help Needed, I'm new

- [ ] Ability to look for two different key words, or an array, or more.
- [ ] As well as passing two or more key words through a search; we need to be able to find these words even if they end with a explanation mark or a period, etc.
- [ ] Option to search through more than 1 subreddit
- [ ] Having the ability to use more than 1 reply would be great; random reply's would be needed for this as used in marvin_bot.py
